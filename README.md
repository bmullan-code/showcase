### [Program Velocity Metrics](https://github.com/wrackzone/program-velocity-metrics)

The goal of this app is to better plan a valuestreams program increment by planning based on previous performance. It is similar to how a team will plan a sprint based on their sprint velocity.

### [Program Increment Scope Change Chart](https://github.com/wrackzone/pi-scope-change-chart)

This app visualizes feature change in scope during a program increment. Scope change is measured against a baseline (vertical redline). Features added are shown 'below the line'. You can mouse over any column to see a summary at the point in time; clicking on a column will show the detailed features at that point in time.
